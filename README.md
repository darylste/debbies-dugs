# Debbies Dugs | Freelance Project

A business website created for a local dog walker. Created using **Next.js** with **TypeScript**. 

## Requirements 

* A small business website which displays services, pricing, and reviews.
* Contact form which allows users to submit a message and contact number/email.
* CMS which allows the owner to update website content without code changes. 
* An image gallery showcasing recent pups. 

## Implementation
### Next.js with TypeScript
I chose to create the Debbies Dugs website using Next.js with TypeScript - utilizing server-rendered pages to improve performance and SEO ranking. I chose to use TypeScript as it provides a better developer experience, with static typing, compile-time errors, and improved IDE support.
### Sanity
I integrated Sanity.io into the application as a headless CMS, allowing the non-technical owner of Debbies Dugs to update content - including services, pricing, reviews, and images - without having to pay for additional code changes. This gives the owner control over the website and allows her to keep content up-to-date.
### SendGrid 
The owner wanted clients to complete a contact form on the website, which would trigger an email with the clients' messages and contact details. I used SendGrid to take the form data and send an email to the business account. This allowed the website to generate new customers for Debbies Dugs and provide a way for clients/potential clients to submit queries or complaints.
